- 👋 Hi, I’m @xXymor, I'm a IT/Audio Technician Supervisor working at a Bike Park.
- 👀 I’m interested in most anything tech related, but mostly Raspberry Pi OS and modding games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about modding MHRise.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. Solo browsing until I get inspired to do a group project.
- 📫 How to reach me @x_Soul#9935 [Discord]
